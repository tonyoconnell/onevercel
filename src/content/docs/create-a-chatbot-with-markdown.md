# Creating a Chatbot with Markdown

This tutorial will show you how to create a specialized AI chatbot a single markdown files in ONE. 

## Step 1: Create Your Markdown File

Create a new markdown file in your pages directory (e.g., `src/pages/your-page.md`): You can make a copy of chat-template.md to get started faster or just copy the text into a markdown file below. 

```markdown
---
layout: ../layouts/Text.astro
title: "Your Page Title"
description: "Your page description"
chatConfig:
  provider: openai
  model: "gpt-4o-mini"
  apiEndpoint: "https://api.openai.com/v1"
  temperature: 0.7
  maxTokens: 4000
  systemPrompt:
    - type: text
      text: "Define your AI assistant's role and expertise here"
  welcome:
    message: "üëã Your welcome message here"
    avatar: "/your-icon.svg"
    suggestions:
      - label: "First Option"
        prompt: "What would you like to know about...?"
---

# Your Content Here
```

## Step 2: Configure the Chat System

### Basic Configuration

In the frontmatter section of your markdown file, configure these essential parameters:

```yaml
chatConfig:
  provider: openai           # AI provider
  model: "gpt-4o-mini"      # Model to use
  temperature: 0.7          # Response creativity (0-1)
  maxTokens: 4000          # Maximum response length
```

### Define the AI's Role

Create a clear system prompt that defines your AI's expertise:

```yaml
systemPrompt:
  - type: text
    text: "You are an expert in [your topic] focused on helping visitors understand [specific aspects]. You provide clear, accurate information about [key areas]."
```

Example prompt for a license page: 
```yaml
systemPrompt:
  - type: text
    text: "You are a licensing expert focused on helping visitors understand the ONE License terms and benefits. You provide clear, accurate information about licensing terms, commercial rights, and usage requirements."
```

### Set Up the Welcome Screen

Configure the initial interaction:

```yaml
welcome:
  message: "üëã Your greeting message here"
  avatar: "/path/to/icon.svg"
  suggestions:
    - label: "üí° First Option"
      prompt: "What would you like to know about...?"
    - label: "üöÄ Second Option"
      prompt: "Another suggested question..."
```

## Step 3: Structure Your Content

Organize your markdown content to help the AI understand the topic:

1. **Clear Headings**
   ```markdown
   # Main Title
   
   ## Key Section
   
   ### Subsection
   ```

2. **Structured Information**
   ```markdown
   ## Key Points
   
   - **First Point** - Detailed explanation
   - **Second Point** - More details
   ```

3. **Organized Sections**
   ```markdown
   ## Topic Area
   
   1. **Main Concept**
      - Detail one
      - Detail two
   
   2. **Another Concept**
      - More information
      - Additional details
   ```

## Step 4: Add Interactive Elements

Include elements that enhance user interaction:

### Quick Access Buttons

```yaml
suggestions:
  - label: "üí° Key Feature"
    prompt: "Tell me about this feature"
  - label: "üöÄ Getting Started"
    prompt: "How do I begin?"
  - label: "‚öñÔ∏è Requirements"
    prompt: "What are the requirements?"
```

### Contact Information

```markdown
Contact [support@example.com](mailto:support@example.com) for assistance.
```

## Real-World Example

```markdown

      text: "You are a licensing expert focused on helping visitors understand the ONE License terms and benefits. You provide clear, accurate information about licensing terms, commercial rights, and usage requirements."
  welcome:
    message: "üëã Hello! I can help explain the ONE License terms and how you can use them for your business."
    avatar: "/icon.svg"
    suggestions:
      - label: "üí° Commercial Rights"
        prompt: "What commercial rights do I get with the ONE License?"
      - label: "üöÄ Getting Started"
